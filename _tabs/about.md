I am a university student stuying math and computer science. I have a background in pure mathematics, but recently discovered applied math in cybersecurity.
I mainly focus on cryptography, but am working towards expanding my knowledge in the world of cyber.
As of now, I'm interested in reverse engineering and network/application security. I also enjoy tinkering with my Thinkpad and hopping between
different Linux distributions. In my free time, I like to play volleyball, listen to jazz fusion, and watch movies.

This website is meant as a portfolio to share some of my projects and writeups, and I will be sporadically when something catches my fancy.
I'm still a relative beginner in this field, so if anything I put out seems inacurate, please feel free to let me know!
