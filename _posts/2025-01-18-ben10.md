# Flag Location

The flag is hidden in the `ben10` image. However, only admins can access `ben10`. The website recognizes admins only if their username starts with `admin`.

```python
if username.startswith('admin') and image_id == 'ben10':
        flag = FLAG
```

We can try registering a new user with a username that starts with `admin`; however, the website doesn't really like that.

```python
if username.startswith('admin') or '^' in username:
            flash("I don't like admins", "error")
            return render_template('register.html')
```

However, the website's database is exploitable to find a username that begins with admin and its password.

# Initialized SQL Database

SQL database is initialized with the following headings.

- ID
- Username
- Password
- Admin Username
- Reset Token

```python
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
										id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
										username TEXT UNIQUE,
										password TEXT,
										admin_username TEXT,
										reset_token TEXT
									)''')
```

After registering with any username and password, an admin username of the form **admin^{username}^{secrets.token_hex(5)}** and a randomly generated password also propagate the database. However, it propagates twice: one for the original username, and one for the admin username.

```python
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, password, admin_username) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", (username, password, admin_username))

cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, password, admin_username) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", (admin_username, admin_password, None))
```

Furthermore, in the **home.html** template, the admin username is accessible to users.

```html
<!-- secret admin username -->
<div style="display:none;" id="admin_data">{{ admin_username }}</div>
```

Thus, if one were to register with a username of **user** and a password of **pass**, the table propagates as follows.

| ID  | Username              | Password | Admin Username        | Reset Token |
| --- | --------------------- | -------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| 0   | user                  | pass     | admin^user^6376eca3d6 |             |
| 1   | admin^user^6376eca3d6 | ######## | None                  |             |

# Resetting Admin Password

We can try to reset the admin password directly using the *Forgot Password?* page. Unfortunately, the website prevents us from resetting the admin password.

```python
if username.startswith('admin'):
	flash("Admin users cannot request a reset token.", "error")
```

However, we can still get the reset token for user, which is **iAg9cgp6Nmf7UPqNI7tDgQ**. The SQL database becomes the following.

| ID  | Username              | Password | Admin Username        | Reset Token            |
| --- | --------------------- | -------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0   | user                  | pass     | admin^user^6376eca3d6 | iAg9cgp6Nmf7UPqNI7tDgQ |
| 1   | admin^user^6376eca3d6 | ######## | None                  |                        |

When it comes to resetting the password, not knowing the reset token for the admin account is irrelevant. The following is the code for resetting the password if the username starts with adminâ€”i.e. if the account is an admin account.

```python
username = username.split('^')[1]
token = get_reset_token_for_user(username)
if token and token[0] == reset_token:
		update_password(request.form['username'], new_password)
		flash(f"Password reset successfully.", "success")
		return redirect(url_for('login'))
```

Notice that the first index after splitting the admin username with the expression "^" is still **user**. The reset token for the admin password, therefore, is also the reset token for the regular account. Thus, we can simply reset the admin password as if its a user account. The database becomes

| ID  | Username              | Password | Admin Username        | Reset Token            |
| --- | --------------------- | -------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0   | user                  | pass     | admin^user^6376eca3d6 | iAg9cgp6Nmf7UPqNI7tDgQ |
| 1   | admin^user^6376eca3d6 | pass     | None                  | iAg9cgp6Nmf7UPqNI7tDgQ |

# Getting the Flag

Now we can log into the website as normal. Opening the *ben10* image file on the website, the flag is found at the bottom.
