## Code Analysis

We're given the following code for a Rabin signature-like oracle that randomly outputs one of the four square roots modulo `n`. If we input a non-numerical value, the oracle then spits out `m` and we have one chance to input an `s` so that `s ^ e == m (mod n)`.

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python
from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime as gP
from random import choice, randint
p, q = gP(512), gP(512)
while p % 4 != 3:
    p = gP(512)

while q % 4 != 3:
    q = gP(512)

n = p * q
e = 0x10001

f = lambda x: ((choice([-1,1]) * pow(x, (p + 1) // 4, p)) * pow(q, -1, p) * q + (choice([-1,1]) * pow(x, (q + 1) // 4, q)) % q * pow(p, -1, q) * p) % n

while True:
    try:
        l = int(input(">>> ")) % n
        print(f(l))
    except:
        break

m = randint(0, n - 1)
print(f"{m = }")
s = int(input(">>> ")) % n
if pow(s,e,n) == m:
    print(open("flag.txt", "r").read())
else:
    print("Wrong signature!")
    exit(1)
```

The challenge here was understanding what `f` does, then figuring out how to get the necessary information using the oracle to find an `s` that works. Full disclosure: I had no idea what the Rabin cryptosystem was before this challenge, and spent a decent amount of time doing research.

### Sketch of Rabin Decryption

The following is a brief explanation of the Rabin cryptosystem. This part isn't essential to solving this CTF, but it's helpful to understanding why it works.

The Rabin cryptosystem is very similar to the RSA cryptosystem, except instead of raising message $m$ to the $e$th power, ciphertext $c \equiv m^{2}\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ n\right)$, where $n = pq$ and $p, q$ are primes such that $p,q\equiv3\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ 4\right)$.

To decrypt $c$, we consider $a \equiv c^{(p+1)/4}\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ p\right)$ and $b\equiv c^{(q+1)/4}\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ q\right)$, which finds the square root of $c$ modulo $p$ and $q$ using Euler's Criterion. I won't prove it here, but consider what Euler's Criterion is and what happens after squaring $a$ or $b$. Then, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find four unique values of $m$ such that $m\equiv\pm a\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ p\right)$ and $m\equiv\pm b\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ q\right)$. In other words,
$$
m\equiv \pm a\cdot q\cdot(q^{-1}\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ p\right))\pm b\cdot p\cdot(p^{-1}\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ q\right)) \ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ n\right).
$$
We can confirm this by taking this expression modulo $p,q$. Would you look at that, this is exactly what the function `f` is!

## Approach

Now that we understand what's going on with the code, we have to figure out how to solve it. Finding a satisfactory `s` is more of an RSA challenge rather than a Rabin challenge. In other words, we need to find decryption key `d` so that `m ^ d == s (mod n)`. To do that, we need to factor `n` some how, and this is where the Rabin decryption oracle comes into play.

### Factoring by Difference of Squares

Suppose $x^{2}\equiv y^{2}\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ n\right)$ and $x \not\equiv y\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ n\right)$. Then, $\gcd\left( x-y , n \right)$ yields a nontrivial factor of $n$.

The proof of this statement is as follows, using contradiction. If $\gcd\left( x-y, n \right)=n$, then $n|x-y$ which gives $x\equiv y\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ n\right),$ which is a contradiction. Furthermore, if $\gcd\left( x-y, n \right)=1,$ then from $n|(x+y)(x-y)$, since $n$ doesn't divide $x-y$, $n|x+y$ and $x\equiv-y\ \left(\mathrm{mod}\ n\right),$ which is also a contradiction. Hence, $\gcd\left( x-y, n \right)$ must be a nontrivial factor of $n.$

### How This Applies

Suppose we were to constantly send `1` to the oracle and receive all of the different square roots modulo `n`. Of course, we would get the trivial `1` and `n - 1` back, but also some other roots `r` and `n - r`. We can find `n` easily by summing the smallest and largest roots, and since `1` is not equal to `r`, so we can factor `n` by taking `gcd(n, r-1)`.

Thus, we can solve for `p` and `q`, and the rest of the solution is simply solving for the private key and decrypting RSA.

## Code Solution

```python
from gmpy2 import gcd
from pwn import remote

HOST = "localhost"
PORT = 5000
r = remote(HOST, PORT)

roots = [1]

while len(roots) != 4:
    r.recvuntil(b">>> ")
    print("[+] Sending 1...")
    r.sendline(b"1")
    root = int(r.recvline().decode().strip())
    if root not in roots:
        roots.append(root)
        roots.sort()
```

In the code above, roots stores all of the square roots of `1`, and the while loop sorts the array every time the oracle spits out a new root.

```python
n = roots[3] + 1
print(f"n = {n}")

p = gcd(n, roots[1] - 1)
q = n // p
print(f"p = {p}")
print(f"q = {q}")

e = 0x10001
phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
d = pow(e, -1, phi)
```

As we mentioned above, we can solve for `n`, `p`, and `q`. Since we know that `e = 0x10001` or `65537`, we can find the decryption key via the RSA decryption algorithm.

Now that we have `d`, we can request the oracle for `m` and solve for `s` to find the flag.

```python
print("[+] Sending new line...")
r.recvuntil(b">>> ")
r.sendline()
r.recvuntil(b"m = ")

m = int(r.recvline().decode())
print(f"m = {m}")

s = pow(m, d, n)
print(f"[+] Sending {s}...")
r.recvuntil(b">>> ")
r.sendline(str(s).encode())

print("[+] Receiving flag...")
flag = r.recvline().decode()
print(flag)

r.close()
```

Again, we find `s` using simple RSA and send the oracle our solution.

## Full Code

```python
from gmpy2 import gcd
from pwn import remote

HOST = "localhost"
PORT = 5000

roots = [1]

r = remote(HOST, PORT)

while len(roots) != 4:
    r.recvuntil(b">>> ")
    print("[+] Sending 1...")
    r.sendline(b"1")
    root = int(r.recvline().decode().strip())
    if root not in roots:
        roots.append(root)
        roots.sort()

e = 0x10001
n = roots[3] + 1
print(f"n = {n}")

p = gcd(n, roots[1] - 1)
q = n // p
print(f"p = {p}")
print(f"q = {q}")

phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
d = pow(e, -1, phi)

print("[+] Sending new line...")
r.recvuntil(b">>> ")
r.sendline()
r.recvuntil(b"m = ")

m = int(r.recvline().decode())
print(f"m = {m}")

s = pow(m, d, n)
print(f"[+] Sending {s}...")
r.recvuntil(b">>> ")
r.sendline(str(s).encode())

print("[+] Receiving flag...")
flag = r.recvline().decode()
print(flag)

r.close()
```

After running the script, we get the following output.
